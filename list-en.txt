NOTES***
In this investigation we use the most popular and used av's.
All the av's shown in this investigation can detect some reverse shell (metasploit, nc, etc) but Windows Defender can't detect reverse shell created with nc if the version is old.
All the av's shown in this investigation can detect files created with Veil Evasion, The FatRat and Msfvenom. Be careful!
The payloads were tested in Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10.
The payloads were injected with diferentes tools for HID attacks as USB Rubber Ducky, Arduino Micro and DigiSpark.
RMSociety is doing various investigations, over time these will be published.
